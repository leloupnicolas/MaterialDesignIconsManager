Material Design Icons Manager: a **Python** binary dedicated to Material Design Icons handling.

## Features
- Icons updates handling
- Icons requiring into Xcode projects
- [TODO] Icons colorizing


## Installation

### Manually

Clone this repo with the following command:

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/leloupnicolas/MaterialDesignIconsManager.git /path/where/you/want/it
```

Make the script usable everywhere:

```
  $ ln -s /usr/local/bin/mdim /path/where/you/want/it/mdim
```

That's all!

## How To

### Choose an icon

Find out the icon's group and name you want to use on [material.io/icons](https://material.io/icons/).

### Import the icon
The following example imports the `event` icon from the `action` to the `Assets.xcassets` assets catalog, in the current Xcode project.

```
  $ mdim require --group=action --icon-name=event
```

This example imports the `event` icon from the `action` to the `MyCustomCatalog.xcassets ` assets catalog, renaming the icon with the name `MyIcon`.

```
  $ mdim require --group=action --icon-name=event --assets-catalog-name=MyCustomCatalog.xcassets --rename-with=MyIcon
```
